I have been working as a Lead Software Engineer for about 2 years and a half. My tasks are:

1. Do what I'm told to do.
2. A cleaner. I need to rework on the existing projects which haven't done correctly, and make sure it is working properly.
3. Do regular code review.
4. Write specs and maintain the code quality.
5. Meet the deadline.
6. Learn new skills.
7. Transform requirements into code and explain others how to do it.

The good thing is that right now I'm the author of the following ruby oss projects.

1. [tenancy](http://github.com/yoolk/tenancy)
2. [themes_on_rails](http://github.com/yoolk/themes_on_rails)
3. [yoolk_api](http://github.com/yoolk/yoolk_api)
4. [active_record_uuid](http://github.com/me/active_record_uuid)
5. [history_tracker](http://github.com/yoolk/history_tracker)
6. [spree-multi-vendor](https://github.com/chamnap/spree-multi-vendor)

At least, I have two PRs.

1. [sunspot](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot/pull/237)
2. [mongoid-likeable](https://github.com/diowa/mongoid-likeable/pull/5)
3. [rails-i18n](https://github.com/chamnap/rails-i18n) I'm working on it now to make it done.
