Last sunday, I talked to some people, around 10 software developers, about how to build web services using REST architecture. However, I didn't talk on my previous slide presentation. I took on [Doing REST Right](http://chamnapchhorn.blogspot.com/2011/03/www.slideshare.net/kjbuckley/doing-rest-right-3385800) by Kerry Buckley. I decided to choose this slide because I feel I learnt something new and it's recommended by my boss, Chris. Actually, I were not well-prepared, but the presentation went well. I missed some slides before I went to do this presentation.
