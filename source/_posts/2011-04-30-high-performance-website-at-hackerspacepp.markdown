I'm a little bit disappointed in myself. What I intended to do presentation is about Web Scaling, but I ended up with go through the front end side. This presentation will focus on how to make your website faster on the front end side. I did focus on some aspects on HTTP concept as well. Those are rules from Steve Souders, but I modify and adjust to make it clear to the audience.
